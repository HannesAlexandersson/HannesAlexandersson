# Who am I? 💻

Hello, I'm <link>Hannes Alexandersson</link>, and I'm embarking on a new journey at the age of 40. For most of my life, I've worked as a specialized nurse in the field of anesthesia, where I've gained valuable experience and expertise in patient care. 😷

However, I've recently discovered my passion for web development, and I'm excited to transition into this new career path. Coding is an entirely new and thrilling world for me, and I'm eager to learn and grow in this field. I believe my background in healthcare has equipped me with valuable skills like attention to detail, problem-solving, and teamwork, which I plan to leverage in my new role as a web developer. 🚀

I'm looking forward to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead and am enthusiastic about becoming a proficient web developer. Let's connect and share in this exciting journey together!

# What I am currently doing 📚

Today, I am still very much in a learning and discovery phase. I'm enrolled at <link>Yrgo</link>, on my way to become a full-stack developer. My day-to-day is full of different small projects and assignments designed to further my skillset.

# What's new? 🌟

In the pipeline for the near future is the 'LIA'. I am about to go out there in the real world to continue to learn in a real-world context! 🌍
